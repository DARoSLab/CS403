# CMPSCI 403: Introduction to Robotics
CMPSCI 403 covers basic methods and concepts in order to explain how robots work. Major topics of this course are kinematics, dynamics, and control, but lectures and homework assignments will cover more broad topics such as actuators, machine learning, and path planning. 

This repository includes codes for the programming assignments of this course. Students are supposed to folk this repository or clone it to somewhere in their own computer to get updates for the assignments, solutions, and other useful codes.
